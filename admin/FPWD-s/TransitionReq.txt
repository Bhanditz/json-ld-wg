% subj: Transition Request: three documents of the JSON-LD Working Group to FPWD

Philippe and Ralph,

The JSON-LD Working Group has resolved [1] to request publication of a FPWD:

* JSON-LD 1.1:  
    * Short Name: json-ld11
    * Document: https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html

* JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API:
    * Short Name:  json-ld11-api
    * Document: https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-api/fpwd/publicationsnapshots/FPWD/Overview.html

* JSON-LD 1.1 Framing:
    * Short Name: json-ld11-framing
    * Document: https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html

Since this is the first publication of these documents, please also approve the shortnames: json-ld11, json-ld11-api, json-ld11-framing, respectively.

The planned publication date is 11 September 2018.

There were no objections to the FPWD publication when taking the resolution[1] on the call, and this has been followed by a CfC call on the WG's mailing list[2] whose deadline is the 10 September. If a formal objection is raised before that deadline, the publication would obviously be stopped.

This request is sent per "How to Organize a Technical Report Transition"[3].

For the co-Chairs of the JSON-LD Working Group,
Ivan Herman
