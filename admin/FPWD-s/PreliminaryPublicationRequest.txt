% To be sent to Denis as soon as the documents pass pubrules
----

Denis,

This is just a preliminary publication request. The JSON LD Working Group has requested a FPWD transition for three documents[1], to be published on the Tuesday, 11 of September. The three documents, with their current location, are:

* JSON-LD 1.1:  
    * Document: https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html

* JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API:
    * Document: https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-api/fpwd/publicationsnapshots/FPWD/Overview.html

* JSON-LD 1.1 Framing:
    * Document: https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html

All three documents go through pubrule's checker as well as the link checker.

I will put them on the /TR/2018/ as soon as we have the Director's decision alongside the official publication request.

Thank you!

Ivan
