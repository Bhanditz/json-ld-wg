# First Public Working Draft: JSON-LD 1.1 Syntax, JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithms and API, and JSON-LD 1.1 Framing

The [W3C JSON-LD Working Group](https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/) has published three First Public Working Drafts today.

* The [JSON-LD 1.1 Syntax](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-json-ld11-20180911/) document defines a JSON-based format to serialize Linked Data. The syntax is designed to easily integrate into deployed systems that already use JSON, and provides a smooth upgrade path from JSON to JSON-LD. It is primarily intended to be a way to use Linked Data in Web-based programming environments, to build interoperable Web services, and to store Linked Data in JSON-based storage engines. The 1.1 version of this specification will extend the existing [JSON-LD 1.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-20140116/) Recommendation, published in 2014.

* The [JSON-LD 1.1 Processing Algorithm and API](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-json-ld11-api-20180911/) document defines a set of algorithms for programmatic transformations of JSON-LD documents. Restructuring data according to the defined transformations often dramatically simplifies its usage. Furthermore, this document proposes an Application Programming Interface (API) for developers implementing the specified algorithms. The 1.1 version of this specification will extend the existing [JSON-LD Processing Algorithm and API](http://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-json-ld-api-20140116/) Recommendation, published in 2014.

* The [JSON-LD 1.1 Framing](https://www.w3.org/TR/2018/WD-json-ld11-framing-20180911/) document defines an approach that allows developers to query by example and force a specific tree layout to a JSON-LD document.

All three documents are derived from Community Group Reports published by the [JSON for Linking Data W3C Community Group](https://www.w3.org/community/json-ld/).

The Working Group welcomes comments via the GitHub repository issues (see the respective documentsâ€™ headers for the reference of the repositories).
