### 4. Issues
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. @type related issues
{: #section4-1}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/4](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/4)

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/4](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/4)

**Benjamin Young:** The issue is "Relax the colliding keywords constraint for @type #4". No obvious reason has been raised not to do this.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this was wrapped up in the general issue of multiple aliases for keywords  
… use case: set the container for @type to @set  
… which would allow it to always compact to an array  
… wouldn't want to reassign @type to something other than IRI  

**Rob Sanderson:** related to #34  
… the coverage example in the issue could be solved by allowing @type to be aliased w/i scoped contexts but not at the top level  
… having it aliased  "one step down" not globally would make the resolution deterministic  

**Gregg Kellogg:** that wouldn't resolve the collision unless the original alias was also removed  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to gkellogg

**Gregg Kellogg:** we have no other case where the rules for scoped contexts are different than general rules for contexts  

> *Rob Sanderson:* {"type": null, "profile": "@type"}

> *Adam Soroka:* g+

**Adam Soroka:** Quickly agree and emphasize that if we do that, we're making a change to treat scoped contexts differently from others  
… that's a big thing!  
… suddenly changes a lot of implementations. So should be very conscious of what we're doing.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** is also worth revisiting the idea of multiple aliases on keywords  

**Gregg Kellogg:** its a judgement call-- relaxing doesn't introduce incompatibility with 1.0  
… 1.0 has a prohibition on multiple aliases to keywords  
… if we relax that, we aren't invalidating any extant 1.0 material  
… we're just not complaining in places where we previously would have  

**Rob Sanderson:** why was the restriction introduced to begin with?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** It's gone out of my head why, at the moment  
… was really thinking about the @type container @set use case  

**Benjamin Young:** give this a bit more time?  

**Rob Sanderson:** shall we get in touch with the original issue creator and ask whether scoped aliases would solve his problem?  
… unless someone else knows of use cases for this issue?

{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Benjamin Young:** lots of these issues have a lot of history  
… okay to delve into that  
… don't be afraid to stop the bus to make sure everyone is still on board  

#### 4.2. `@type` as `@container:@set`?
{: #section4-2}

> *Ivan Herman:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/34](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/34)

**Gregg Kellogg:** this was a reason to allow repeated aliasing for keywords  
… in this case to alias the keyword @type  
… not to change its identity, just the container treatment  
… e.g. to @set. Of course, some values wouldn't be valid here, like @list  
… might want to constrain that. shouldn't be a problem with other keywords  

**David Newbury:** examples for both @type and @context are useful  
… we hit this while trying to support objects that are both IIIF and CIDOC/CRM  
… objects with multiple rdf:types  
… then our documentation gets very complex to account for multiple possible shapes.  
… the processor has to look for both a string or an array  
… so this would make that work easier  

> *Benjamin Young:* CIDOC/CRM - [http://www.cidoc-crm.org/](http://www.cidoc-crm.org/)

> *Benjamin Young:* IIIF - [http://iiif.io/](http://iiif.io/)

> *Rob Sanderson:* You can't compact to:   "@type": ["Manifest"]  or "@context": ["http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json"]

**Rob Sanderson:** basically, you can't compact to @type as a single item in a list  
… having the capacity for both @context and @type would be valuable  
… seems very reasonable for @type  

**Benjamin Young:** there is a config option for at least some JSON-LD processors to force things into an array when compacted  
… could that be brought to an API parsing level, and not a syntactic level  

**Ivan Herman:** feeling a bit lost!  

**Rob Sanderson:** what we're suggesting is not illegal in 1.0, it just can't be compacted to  

**Ivan Herman:** the difficulty here is when compacted, not the original syntax?  
… ie, an API-level problem  
… if I have an author who doesn't know or care about the spec, what can she write down than is valid  

**Rob Sanderson:** I agree that it is an API problem  

**Ivan Herman:** mod'ing the context for the purpose of the APIs-- I have a disconnect  

**Rob Sanderson:** the result of the compaction algorithm has a single class in an array  
… so we are really making @type be consistent with all the others  

**Ivan Herman:** any exceptions that are not justified are WRONG!  

**Rob Sanderson:** again, an API-level thing. you should be able to spec in the syntax which of the two options you want  
… it's a question of the compaction algo and how we signal to it which of the two possible things to do  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* compactArrays

> *Gregg Kellogg:* If set to true, the JSON-LD processor replaces arrays with just one element with that element during compaction. If set to false, all arrays will remain arrays even if they have just one element.

> *Benjamin Young:* +1 to adding these config options to the playground

**Gregg Kellogg:** the "compact arrays" option in the API: if set to false, all values will be represented as arrays  
… don't know if current algorithms do that for contexts, but arguably they should  
… playground doesn't expose these options. that's an issue for us to take up with json-ld.org  
… the reason to set @type as container @set is to make the use of arrays uniform, but if the option compactArrays already handles that  
… then let's not complicate the algorithms to do the same thing  
… wrt to @type vs @context, you cannot alias @context in a JSON-LD for obvious bootstrapping reasons  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to considering weight!

**Rob Sanderson:** if I have a bunch of triples from (say) a triplestore than describe a single class, can Gregg explain how to get to JSON-LD with an array of types  

**Gregg Kellogg:** let's take a single triple, set compactArrays = false, you should get that.  
… not just for @type, for anything  

**Rob Sanderson:** how does that interact with @container @set  

**Gregg Kellogg:** if compactArrays=true (the default), then it is overridden by @container @set, if false, @container @set is irrelevant  

**David Newbury:** is compactArrays required?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** normative/required  
… and we have good coverage in the test suite  
… might be good to do a sweep and make sure we're getting all the combinatorics  
… we might not be getting every possible result in an array right now  

> *Benjamin Young:* compaction tests fwiw [https://json-ld.org/test-suite/#Compaction](https://json-ld.org/test-suite/#Compaction)

**David Newbury:** might be good to add more info about API options to the documentation  
… only ever seen such docs in the docs for given impls.  
… which could lead people to assume that they are impl-specific  
… especially since the playground doesn't expose them  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I have a distiller that exposes them, could use that to expose that in the playground  

**David I. Lehn:** the compactArrays option will cover everything, @type @container @set is much more controllled/specific  
… as far as options on the playground, been thinking about that but haven't gotten around to it... help wanted!  

> *Rob Sanderson:* compact arrays would prevent: {"property1": "only ever one value", "property2": ["sometimes multiple values"]}?

**Benjamin Young:** the normativeness of the API has come up e.g. with Activity Streams  
… one of the stones thrown in that conversation was that "JSON-LD hasn't got a normative API"  
… what I found was from the CG specs, and not connected with JSON-LD 1.0  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the WebIDL that describes the API has been part of the docs from the beginning  
… the API is written using "promises", which is really a JS-land feature  
… the processing steps for "compact" first discuss "expanding", which isn't even in that document  
… anything passing the test suite has to make use of that aspect of the API anyway  

**Benjamin Young:** the "promises" thing also came up in that conversation, so if there's another way...  

**Gregg Kellogg:** It was important that the API could be async, previously we tried a callback style  
… the API has always been very JS-centric. believe that to be true of all WebIDL use at W3C  

**Rob Sanderson:** when I first tried to do the @type stuff, I tried to use compactArrays, but when some values can be 1 or more, and some can be 0..1, compactArrays make them all into arrays  
… which is not what was wanted a  
… so there is still a use case here, in spite of compactArrays  

**Gregg Kellogg:** would support a narrowly-worded resolution that specifically allows aliases for @type, for which the only thing that can be set is @container and the only value  
… to which it could be set would be @set.  
… and an alias of that type would have the same restrictions  

**Rob Sanderson:** that meets the use case without overstepping

> ***Resolution #3: @type (or an alias of it) can be set to be only a @container, and have only the value of @set***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** need to close off the question for @context  
… @context is so different from anything else...  
… would be very dangerous to touch it

{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**David I. Lehn:** +1 but fine to re-raise issue if there are good use cases  

**Ivan Herman:** yes, we can reopen  

#### 4.3. Allow processing model of @type to be customized #7
{: #section4-3}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/7](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/7)

**Gregg Kellogg:** @type is different, has a different processing model  
… some complaints about this, requests to change that so that @type uses a diff processing model  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to wontfix

**Rob Sanderson:** original issue has an example of what happens now  
… is there an ambiguity here?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** if you are expanding a bare word "foo", how you expand depends on the presence of an @vocab  
… but not @type  
… it being common to define types themselves within the document  
… so relative IRIs are really useful there  
… how to process @type is defined by the spec itself, not by the context of a given doc  
… opening that up could introduce injection attacks via the context,  

**Rob Sanderson:** the result that the original requestor wanted, could be done by taking out @vocab and defining individual entries  
… they just want to shorten that up  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yep, and could also be done via scoped contexts  

**Adam Soroka:** If we do this, we need to offer various solutions in examples in the specs  

**Gregg Kellogg:** A best practices document  

**Adam Soroka:** Exactly! :)
