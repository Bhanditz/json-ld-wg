> *David Newbury:* +1

> *Rob Sanderson:* project link: [https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4)

**Rob Sanderson:** tpac coming up; we also have made a project for the issues we are working on  
… helps tracking issues over all 3 repos we are working on  
… decide on topics that are probably better discussed during the F2F meeting  
… if there's anything else we could configure on that regard, please speak up  
… any other announcements or reminders?  

**Ivan Herman:** a minor thing, if we have anything to discuss with other working groups we should do that  
… e.g., publication working group meets on Monday/Tuesday  
… you are more than welcome to join  

> ***Action #1: Rob to create a meta issue for cross-WG sessions at TPAC***
{: #action1 .action}

### 3. FPWDs
{: #section3}

**Rob Sanderson:** according to our charter, we should have published FPWDs  
… our documents are way more mature than required for FPWD  

**Ivan Herman:** publishing FPWD needs more administrative actions  
… reason being that IPR starts with the FPWD  
… publishing FPWD cannot be automated  
… we need a formal vote for publishing each of the 3 documents  
… this includes also deciding on their respective short names  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* json-ld11, json-ld11-api, json0-ld11-framing

> *Gregg Kellogg:* snapshots [https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html,](https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html,)  [https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-api/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html,](https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-api/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html,) [https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html](https://rawgit.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/fpwd/publication-snapshots/FPWD/Overview.html)

**Ivan Herman:** we'll vote here, it's not binding yet, but will become so in a week from now  
… unless someone objects to it  
… publications happen on Tuesdays/Thursdays  
… on the 11th is the earliest date we could publish  

**Rob Sanderson:** any questions?  

> **Proposed resolution: Approve the current snapshots for publication as FPWD for September 11th** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** ivan has suggested some changes, so they would not be exactly the same shapshots  

> **Proposed resolution: Approve for publication as FPWD for September 11th the documents as json-ld11, json-ld11-api and json-ld11-framing** *(Rob Sanderson)*

**Gregg Kellogg:** having issues in the public documents, sometimes cause some issues  
… broken links and such  

**Ivan Herman:** when you incorporate github issues with respec, you can define your own text instead of taking the one from github  

> ***Resolution #2: Approve for publication as FPWD for September 11th the documents as json-ld11, json-ld11-api and json-ld11-framing***
{: #resolution2 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** you ping me when the documents are frozen, gkellogg ?  
… you'll generate static HTML, right?  

**Ivan Herman:** once you've pinged me, I'll start the process  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yes  

### 4. Issues
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. Ordering of keys, https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/8
{: #section4-1}

> *Ivan Herman:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/8](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/8)

**Rob Sanderson:** we discussed over the week, proposal is in the agenda  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the reason for having the ordering, was for the tests being then easier to evaluate  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we should put something in the test readme, describing this kind of result checking  

**Rob Sanderson:** does this also apply to scoping by type?  

> **Proposed resolution: Remove the "ordered lexicographically by key" from the serialization algorithm and allow implementations to handle this as they see fit** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1

> *Simon Steyskal:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

**David I. Lehn:** has anyone tried doing this change to see if anything breaks?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yeah, for compacting e.g., where you only have to sort the compacted output  
… I haven't implemented the more complex result checking though  

**Gregg Kellogg:** current algorithms should be able to deal with that  
… ordering was actually one of the things that makes processing expensive  

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

> ***Resolution #3: Remove the "ordered lexicographically by key" from the serialization algorithm and allow implementations to handle this as they see fit***
{: #resolution3 .resolution}

#### 4.2. support JSON literal values - https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/4
{: #section4-2}

> *Ivan Herman:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/4](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/4)

**Ivan Herman:** defining a datatype for RDF would make the whole thing complete  
… we could do that I think  
… but postponing it to a future RDF WG is maybe not a good thing (it doesn't exist yet)  

**Rob Sanderson:** in the social web WG, they created a new LDP property  
… the annotation WG doesn't want to get the same thing done to them (as they said in a disclaimer)  

**Ivan Herman:** creating a new datatype isn't the same thing as changing the ontology  
… we are not required to put it in the RDF namespace  

**Rob Sanderson:** the question is more "where should it live"  

> *Rob Sanderson:* comment - [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/4#issuecomment-416757994](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/4#issuecomment-416757994)

**Gregg Kellogg:** I certainly support adding a JSON datatype to RDF  
… should be whitespace normalized  
… having implemented this, in theory this should work  
… there might be some problematic corner cases wrt. to framing  
… storing an empty array as json object in a frame for example  

> *ivan>Exampl:* that can be reused: [https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html](https://www.w3.org/TR/rdf11-concepts/#section-html)

**Ivan Herman:** we can have a separate section in our own document where we define this  

**Ivan Herman:** you can see from the HTML example, it's a relative simple thing  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I was referring to the actual namespace documents  

**Ivan Herman:** which ones?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** if we decide to put it in the RDF namespace  

**Ivan Herman:** that's something we could do, because they are not in TR  
… the important thing is that it's really a short thing, not a big deal  

> **Proposed resolution: Define a @json keyword, initially mapped to jsonld:json, for use with @type to indicate the @value is a json literal value** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Gregg Kellogg:** this does have utility outside of GeoJSON  
… it does put json literals on the same level as xml/html ones

{: #resolution4 .resolution}

> *David I. Lehn:* should it be caps jsonld:JSON to align with those rdf:HTML etc names?

#### 4.3. compaction issues, #3 and #6
{: #section4-3}

> *simonstey>link:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/3](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/3)

> *simonstey>link:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/6](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/6)

**Rob Sanderson:** closely related  
… issue 6 is exactly the same but for @id  
… use case is consistency  
… some things require arrays having a consistent datatype  

> *Rob Sanderson:* gkellogg:

> *Simon Steyskal:* [azaroth explaining the issues]

**Gregg Kellogg:** there was a concern, we may need an extra keyword  
… to be able to handle this case  

> *Rob Sanderson:* Explanation: In order to allow consistent JSON output, compaction should allow for values and resources to be compacted to a JSON object with a single key of @id or @value

**Ivan Herman:** it would be very difficult to give an understandable story of what the keywords are  
… as we are already overloading them quite a bit  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

**Ivan Herman:** they make sense on an incremental basis, but looking at them as a whole things may become a bit blurry  
… here we are reusing keywords for transforming json-ld from one format to another  

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1 to ivan's concern

**Ivan Herman:** as of now, I would like to leave this issue open  
… maybe discussing it at TPAC in more detail the set of keywords and their usage  

> *Rob Sanderson:* Similar situation as the "data type coercion" issue

**Gregg Kellogg:** conceptually this (i.e., type none) would mean that the type of those values don't really have a meaning  
… I understand the concern about overloading  

**Ivan Herman:** on a micro level those changes are fine, but I would like to leave it open nevertheless  

**David Newbury:** understanding what keywords have an effect on JSON output is non-trivial  
… mapping algorithms to how input maps to output is not really straightforward  

> **Proposed resolution: Accept the use case for #3 and #6, and continue to discuss the solution** *(Rob Sanderson)*

{: #resolution5 .resolution}

#### 4.4. https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/15
{: #section4-4}

> *Ivan Herman:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/15](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/15)

**Rob Sanderson:** list-like structures for other ontologies  

**Gregg Kellogg:** something like this was contemplated in 1.0 too  
… the only way of creating an ordered list of items in json-ld is basically to leverage rdf list  
… adding additional means for creating ordered lists, e.g., by utilizing the ordered list ontology  
… hoping that danbri starts to show up at some point  

> *Rob Sanderson:* It also led to:  [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/17](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/17)

**Ivan Herman:** we have to see if this issue is still as high on the list for schema.org as it used to be  

**Rob Sanderson:** it seems like a lot of work  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/595#issuecomment-368258625](https://github.com/json-ld/json-ld.org/issues/595#issuecomment-368258625)

**Ivan Herman:** we should be extremely careful in opening this can of worms  
… sounds more like 2.0 than 1.1  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1!

> *Ivan Herman:* +1 to adam
