#### 4.1. Framing as a verb
{: #section4-1}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/13](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/13)

**Rob Sanderson:** OP notes that "framing" isn't "surrounding with a structure"  
… so why call it framing?  
… but that ship has sailed: the term is in use  

**Benjamin Young:** q about short names.  
… "JSON-LD 1.1" is the name of one of our docs, version issues later might make that make no sense  

**Rob Sanderson:** Short names must be approved by W3C mgmnt, because they serve as "namespaces"  
… but working drafts do not  
… changing the short name is more involved than creating a new version  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it's been called "JSON-LD Framing" from the beginning  

**Gregg Kellogg:** wasn't part of RDF 1.1, but has been known as "framing" since then  
… dlehn may know more  
… but the ship really has sailed

#### 4.2. subtitle for framing
{: #section4-2}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/14](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/14)

**Gregg Kellogg:** the subtitle of this doc is the name as I just described: "JSON-LD"  
… it's an extension to the API spec, but the subtitle doesn't make that clear

#### 4.3. Remove bnode naming requirement
{: #section4-3}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/25](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/issues/25)

**Gregg Kellogg:** creates some complications for testing, because you can't use bnode labels  
… expansion does not rename bnodes  
… flattening does  
… but you can use either normalization or isomorphism to compare  
… but for a structural comparision we compare triples and expand to check lists  
… so that would include bnode names  
… so the only thing left is to flatten, turn into triples, and compare to see that the graphs are the _same_  
… there was some discussion about using a bijection for comparison, but that made for a very complex test arrangement  
… and we might not verify that the topology of the flattened doc is correct  

**Harold Solbrig:** it concerns me to offer a bnode labelling algorithm-- it might "leak"  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://json-ld.github.io/normalization/spec/](https://json-ld.github.io/normalization/spec/)

**Gregg Kellogg:** dataset normalization offers this  
… because you have to be able to offer _exactly_ the same quads  

**Harold Solbrig:** would support making bnode labelling non-normative  
… understand the problem with testing, but more worried about becoming a "standard" for bnode labelling  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it's already out there since 1.0  
… so we might end up with a non-normative discussion instead  

**Rob Sanderson:** how breaking a change is this?  

> *David I. Lehn:* as someone who may have to deal with the testing implementation, i'm somewhat unclear on what problems may come up with this

**Rob Sanderson:** will we be breaking 1.0 systems  

**Gregg Kellogg:** depends on whether people depend on bnode names  
… similar to bnodes for properties  

**Rob Sanderson:** what would be the requirement after this?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** thought it would be that bnode names must be unique and non-overlapping  
… and if an algorithm can use our mapping, testing will be easier  
… q is: can we eliminate it, or mark it as obsolete?  

**Benjamin Young:** thinking from JSON perspective  
… suppose someone is using the algorithms to go from JSON, what effect does this have?  
… these effects could be shocking to a JSON user  

**Gregg Kellogg:** these are unkowns  
… smilar to what happens with most RDF parserse  
… e.g. round trip from Turtle to NTriples, many people would expect bnode labels to be preserved  
… but that's not guaranteed, just convenient  

> *Rob Sanderson:* oooh, +1 to marking at risk

**Gregg Kellogg:** might mark this "at-risk" to get more feedback  

**David I. Lehn:** wanted to ask what problems may come up with this  

**Gregg Kellogg:** one type: people who rely on knowledge of the names generated  
… which is just a really bad thing to do, but they might have done it  

> *David I. Lehn:* mostly my questions are how much pain this could cause for the test runner implementation ;)

**Gregg Kellogg:** then there's ordering.  
… part of the purpose of this algo is to preserve document order  
… but if bnode names are different, could reorder output  
… could use an unorder comparison for tests  
… or could reduce each to triples and then again, normalization or compare by isomorphism  

> *David I. Lehn:* sounds like this will need an early set of tests just to test that the test runner comparison code works

**Gregg Kellogg:** would require more testing and discussion  
… will be a pain for devs  
… but devs could continue to use the informativ algos  

**Jeff Mixter:** more of a philosophical apporach  
… agree with "data-first" approach, think of bnodes as wildcards  
… sad if devs have relied on naming  
… but it's the problem of parsing, not the data  

**Rob Sanderson:** some might argue that we broke their nice little code  
… if they're sad, they can respond to the "at risk" status  
… and if they don't we go ahead  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we can make this more visible in the next WD, with a blog post

#### 4.4. Base of an embedded JSON-LD block
{: #section4-4}

> *Rob Sanderson:* link: [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/23](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/23)

**Rob Sanderson:** we don't normatively spec the base URI for a JSON-LD block  
… inside HTML  
… could be several choices  
… some of which could be further dependenet on other parts of the HTML doc  
… the ticket has discussion for other problems with embedded JSON-LD, but let's stick to base URI for this issue  
… base is relatively clear  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it's the principle of least surprise  
… if I load an HTML doc and it include JSON-LD w/ relative URIs  
… they must be resolved  
… make sense to use the doc base  
… but what if I change the doc base using base head element  
… used in RDFa  
… would be odd if JSON-LD and RDFa in same page had diff base  
… could be a pain, but it is what the DOM uses  
… if we do something different, that would be even more surprising  

**Benjamin Young:** all kinds of concerns about this  
… about using data from non-Javascript mimetype surroundings  
… yes, you can have all kinds of info about a script tag, but I wouldn't expect it to change the text extracted from that script tag  
… requiring interplay between the DOM and what's in the script tag is a dangerous precedent and would have a lot of overhead  
… would expect the base of the JSON-LD would be the same as if it were raw, sent by itself  

**David I. Lehn:** while trying to generate framed json-ld which is not publshed  
… and therefore have no base  
… I've had to invent one to get the algos to work  
… our docs seem to assume that the JSON-LD exists "at a location"  

**Benjamin Young:** that affects Linked Data all over  
… at WIley we do a lot of RDFa and JSON together  
… we use a hash  

**David Newbury:** I've been creating a base, even just "example.com"  

**Gregg Kellogg:** has been an issue in the PLayground  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986#section-5.1)

**Gregg Kellogg:** we want apps to have something to use  
… in the absence of anything explicit  
… if the mediatype is json-ld, we have a known way to establish a base with in the context  
… but what about w/i a script tag  
… we can say, it's based on the URI that was used to retrieve the document  
… there's doc base, head base, and xml:base  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#data-block](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/semantics-scripting.html#data-block)

**Benjamin Young:** in that paragraph HTML5 says nothing around the script tag can have any effect on the stuff inside it  
… we would break that  
… would make a species of special JSON-LD style HTML parsers  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* 1=

**Benjamin Young:** moving the bar for consumption the wrong way-- towards harder  

**Gregg Kellogg:** excellent reference, can use that to solve this

> **Proposed resolution: When establishing the base URI, use the document base URL only and ignore all surrounding data such as xml:base** *(Rob Sanderson)*

> *David Newbury:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Harold Solbrig:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** e.g. if YAML came up with some internal way to change the base, this proposal would tell us to ignore that too  

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

**Rob Sanderson:** or any other serialization  

**Gregg Kellogg:** not sure we can be that broad  
… this reference is only good for this mediatype  
… other mediatypes may have their own policies  
… but in the absence of such specific guidance, we default to this stance from HTML5  

> ***Resolution #4: When establishing the base URI, use the document base URL only and ignore all surrounding data such as xml:base***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* Also +1 to Gregg's clarified clarification :D

**Benjamin Young:** but this is all within HTML5  
… so that is the dictator we use as a conveyance  
… but we've now nailed this to the wall succinctly  

**Rob Sanderson:** we can reuse this guidance for language and text direction  

> **Proposed resolution: Language, text direction and similar are not affected by surrounding content, such as attributes on containing HTML elements** *(Rob Sanderson)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

**Gregg Kellogg:** the wording here is all negative  
… we could instead say "only this way is correct"
