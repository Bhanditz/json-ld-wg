### 1. Approve Minutes
{: #section1}

**Benjamin Young:** Any questions or corrections?  
… it doesn't say what group Telco these are, also missing chair name  

**Ivan Herman:** I will take care of it  

**Benjamin Young:** Chair was me last week  

### 2. Announcements
{: #section2}

> *Benjamin Young:* 2019 Spring Face-to-Face - February 7-8 (Thursday & Friday) in Washington, DC

**Adam Soroka:** we have location and rooms, will get that out very soon  
… we got a room in the Smithstonian castle  
… will get recommendations about hotels, but location is downtown DC on National Mall  

**Ivan Herman:** I have prepared a file for f2f  
… so Adam, you can put info in this google doc  

> *Ivan Herman:* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/11agKfDU1vTjyKBI_ytLBYFChFCqEfFePNVposnmSW_8/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11agKfDU1vTjyKBI_ytLBYFChFCqEfFePNVposnmSW_8/edit?usp=sharing) -> F2F meeting page

### 3. Call schedule for the remainder of 2018
{: #section3}

**Benjamin Young:** As far as I know we have 14 Dec., but do we need either of the next 2 weeks (21 & 28)?  
… I will be unavailable those 2 weeks  
… does anyone need a call on either of those days?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** May not be available either date. Not sure yet.  

**Benjamin Young:** sounds like we should skip 21 & 28 and restart on 4 January  

**Ivan Herman:** do we keep 4 January?  
… let's do 4th, drop 28 dec and not sure about 21 dec  

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* for what it's worth, I'll probably be unavailable on the 21; and surely on the 28

**Benjamin Young:** will query the list about 21 dec and 4 jan  

### 4. Recent Changes / Merges
{: #section4}

**Benjamin Young:** Greg please summarize these  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/56](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/56)

**Gregg Kellogg:** issue 56 - this was looking for examples to indicate unexpected behavior when type is a vocab  
… i think ball was in Ivan's court whether the examples were sufficient  
… we are not closing the issue until after the PR, so question is whether we are ready to close  
… we added 2 examples  
… next issue is 77, disambiguate uses of @type  
… Webex seems to have some problems with this meeting, especially if changing focus on my computer  
… we discussed adding @datatype, instead decided to add text around different uses of @type  
… are people satisfied with wording?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** use of `@none` regarding language  
… in seeming conflict with requirement that language has to be string, @none didn't specify  
… fixed that wording making clear that `@none` has to be a string  

**Benjamin Young:** these are tagged proposed closing  
… we need to decide if ready to close  

**Adam Soroka:** I wanted to mention the `@datatype` issue - I'm okay with this, but we may need a gitHub tag for whenever issues about @type comes up  
… this will be a way to verify that spec wording update is enough to minimize confusion  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-wg/issues/24](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-wg/issues/24)

**Gregg Kellogg:** I did raise issue 24 about surfacing the minutes on this topic like we did in Community Group  
… could we do this?  
… was useful in community group  

**Ivan Herman:** minutes cleanup is done by me, and summarizing each meeting may not be a good idea  

**Gregg Kellogg:** there is a scribe tool that builds summaries and indexes automatically  

**Benjamin Young:** it works on issues and action lists at top/bottom of each meeting minutes  

**Gregg Kellogg:** the good thing is it aggregates all minutes on each issue  

**Benjamin Young:** I will take an action to investigate to see if we can build index of minutes by issue  
… I think this is a good idea  

**Gregg Kellogg:** will work with bigbluehat on this since I worked on CG  

**Benjamin Young:** can we close these 3 issues  
… 56, 77 and 102 ?  

**Ivan Herman:** can we do a resolution to close these 3 issues?

> ***Resolution #1: close issues 56, 77, and 102 as having been addressed by recent merges***
{: #resolution1 .resolution}

**Benjamin Young:** one more propose closing to consider, issue 76  
… it's marked as out of scope.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** no editorial work has been done on this  

**Benjamin Young:** we'll put on agenda for next meeting (dec 14)  

#### 4.1. Remove the need for wrapping comment-open/comment-close text in data blocks
{: #section4-1}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/97](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/97)

**Gregg Kellogg:** most of these are related to PRs just discussed, but not all  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/96](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/96)

**Benjamin Young:** current draft talks now about html entities for escaping  

**Gregg Kellogg:** given that it has to be valid json-ld, how do we deal with escaped entities  
… leaves us with problem of how to represent `<script>` tags and comments in json?  
… so we could close 97 and leave 100 for further discussion  

**Benjamin Young:** one option is to mark propose closing and discuss more later  

**Gregg Kellogg:** DanBri involved and noted in discussion (of this or another related issue 100)

{: #resolution2 .resolution}

#### 4.2. Text and tests for using HTML base for embedded JSON-LD
{: #section4-2}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/51](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/51)

**Benjamin Young:** this one is about how to resolve urls are resolved, e.g., how html base is used  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/23](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/23)

**Gregg Kellogg:** the associated issue is 23, which we have closed  
… this does not deal with referencing html for context and that should stay a separate issue  

**Benjamin Young:** does anyone want to write up this other issue - Adam volunteered  
… any issues about recent merge  

#### 4.3. Text and tests for using HTML base for embedded JSON-LD
{: #section4-3}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/51](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/51)

#### 4.4. Clarify IRI compaction
{: #section4-4}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/52](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-api/pull/52)

**Gregg Kellogg:** PR 52 resolves issue 75  
… based on previous discussion, I did use autoclose on this  

**Benjamin Young:** last chance for anyone to raise questions about this PR  

### 5. Pending PRs
{: #section5}

#### 5.1. Clarify that language map values of `@none` are strings
{: #section5-1}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/104](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/pull/104)

**Benjamin Young:** hearing none, we will move on  

**Benjamin Young:** 104 is about clarifying the language map and use of @none  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this is like the one discussed earlier  
… giving Rob a chance to comment  

**Benjamin Young:** would love people raising questions / comments between calls, but want to provide opportunity on calls as needed  
… we need to better relate PRs and issues being closed  

### 6. Issues to be closed
{: #section6}

#### 6.1. Handling HTML character references in embedded JSON-LD
{: #section6-1}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/100](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/100)

**Benjamin Young:** so far most of work has been Greg and Dan  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this is a relatively narrow issue - we should solve by not resolving html entities in the API  
… the narrow use case is script tags and comments  
… so we should document by clarifying in spec language but not resolving the html entities  
… if an html embedded in json (which is inside a script tag) closes the script tag, then rest of json will be treated as body  
… in theory you can end up embedding javascript  
… I suggest we document and say don't do this  
… and leave browser to defend against this  

**Benjamin Young:** agree this seems not our problem  
… people who put end script tag in their json-ld will find that they've broken their html  
… if people need to escape character entities, they'll do, but it will become an html issue not our problem  
… while we don't want to avoid edge cases, this still doesn't seem to be our issue  
… but would love to her back from Dan on this  
… just add note that you could disrupt html parsing by doing this and leave it at that  

**Adam Soroka:** I don't want to minimize the security concern, but since this is coming from server side, it seems not as threatening  
… not as bad from accepting user input  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I would propose that we close this issue and remove all except a non-normative caution note  
… that data block should remain valid  
… I don't anticipate anything different on this from schema.org  
… this removes some text from API doc and maybe some changes in syntax document where we currently talk about how to escape

{: #resolution3 .resolution}

#### 6.2. Introduce concept of "sealed" contexts
{: #section6-2}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/20](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/20)

**Benjamin Young:** Digital Bazar has weighed in with more of their use cases that break  

**Adam Soroka:** A meta comment - Digital Bazar has been producing interesting and valuable use cases  
… can we get someone from Digital Bazar to join an upcoming call  

**David I. Lehn:** I'm here but not ready to volunteer on this issue  

**Benjamin Young:** We need to get some more time and get additional folks from Digital Bazar  
… other thoughts?  
… hearing nothing now, please keep working on this issue on GitHub  

#### 6.3. Allow @type for @none in Language Maps
{: #section6-3}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/91](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/91)

**Benjamin Young:** Idea with 91 is that there is no way to fall back to HTML, which international has suggested is best way to deal with language issues  

**Gregg Kellogg:** issue is to allow non-string values, for which a value object without type might be one option, and opening that door allows almost anything  
… that ruins the normality, and not sure it helps the use case  
… seems you'd be more likely to use either all language tags or all html literals  

**Ivan Herman:** i think you should either close or defer - this issue did come up in pub wg  
… their concern is a bit convoluted to talk about  
… when I wrote it down, I got a private message that they didn't really like this solution (right after TPAC)  
… pinged them 2 days ago.  
… the result may be that in JSON and JSON-LD this issue can not be done perfectly, and we should be cognizant of perfect is the enemy of the good  
… title element seems one place where this could come up, but title doesn't allow html text  
… we should avoid being more catholic than the pope  

**Adam Soroka:** mostly agreeing with what's been said  
… a pattern of string, string, string, complex stuff, string, string is not good  

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

**Adam Soroka:** goes against trying to keep json-ld in line with expectations  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** I agree that this is a strange use case, but regardless i posted a solution that works in dev playground  
… having 2 distinct properties, one accept a string, one a language map  

**Benjamin Young:** similar to Annotation and Social WG for some of their specs  

**Pierre-Antoine Champin:** a little more cumbersome  

> **Proposed resolution: close #91 as wrong solution for the right problem** *(Benjamin Young)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

**Adam Soroka:** the kind of thing pchampin is offering seems a good option, can we open an issue to generate examples  

> *Ivan Herman:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Pierre-Antoine Champin:* +1

**Adam Soroka:** this is a pattern that could be confusing, we should offer best practices  

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

> *Adam Soroka:* +1

> ***Resolution #4: close #91 as wrong solution for the right problem***
{: #resolution4 .resolution}

**Ivan Herman:** can I close after transferring comments to issue?  

**Benjamin Young:** yes  

**Benjamin Young:** adjourn
