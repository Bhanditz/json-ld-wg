### 2. Announcements / Reminders
{: #section2}

**Benjamin Young:** now at fpwd stage!  
… we now have 3 URLs  
… also had a blog post go up  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7270](https://www.w3.org/blog/news/archives/7270)

**Benjamin Young:** 1.1 specs are available for people to review and provide feedback  
… by doing this, we are seeing some people taking a fresh look at json-ld and that is beneficial  

> *Rob Sanderson:* e.g. [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/13](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/13) and [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/14](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/14)

**Gregg Kellogg:** next thing to discuss is policy and mechanism for regular working drafts  

**Benjamin Young:** so, what cadence  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yes, and we should have a relatively low bar when we update  
… does anyone have experience keeping link checker happy?  

**Benjamin Young:** do we want an issue about these matters?  

**Gregg Kellogg:** will do.  

> ***Action #1: Gregg Kellogg to add issues related to continuous publication of working drafts***
{: #action1 .action}

### 3. TPAC
{: #section3}

**Benjamin Young:** getting close. Scheduled for Thurs and Fri of TPAC  
… may also have an informal WG dinner earlier in week  
… we have also put a doc up for discussing our agenda.  

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qTLztv7nqbYuUsZbwhPhOyG5tHTJrTt9tGKWnD5Xa5A/edit#](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qTLztv7nqbYuUsZbwhPhOyG5tHTJrTt9tGKWnD5Xa5A/edit#)

**Benjamin Young:** includes rsvp for TPAC WG meeting and for those wanting to call in  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4](https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/4)

**Rob Sanderson:** in the project we have a column for discuss face-to-face  
… so people should add / move to make sure this column has all the items we want to cover in f2f  
… as time allows we will then work our way through other issues  

**Simon Steyskal:** will there be remote access?  

**Benjamin Young:** we are planning on it - you can rsvp for that in planning doc  

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1 to remote access

**Rob Sanderson:** minor note - in the doc there is a list to TPAC reg list, includes people requesting observer status  
… as of last week I told observers who had registered were welcome  
… looks like a good group of observers  

**Benjamin Young:** encourage others as appropriate  
… any other announcements or agenda items for today?  
… hearing none, we will proceed  

### 4. Issues
{: #section4}

#### 4.1. IRI vs URL - https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/25
{: #section4-1}

**Rob Sanderson:** discussions a little quiet this week, but IRI vs. URL has gotten some discussion  
… issue - should we adopt URL or should we stick with IRI  
… for example, HTML has a note about why that spec uses URL, but Web annotation has a note from member from Sony about differences between URL and IRI  
… on the table is idea to defer until it becomes more clear  

**Gregg Kellogg:** microdata spec uses URL and includes some RDF, possibly providing a model for using URL in context of RDF  

> *Benjamin Young:* current Working Draft of the Microdata spec [https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/](https://www.w3.org/TR/microdata/)

**Gregg Kellogg:** issues lurking about impact on SPARQL, etc.  
… probably this means we need a wider scope than just json-ld  

**Rob Sanderson:** one of the editors of microdata is Dan Bri who is in this WG, another is Charles  
… so lets grab them at TPAC and get a better sense of their feelings  

> **Proposed resolution: Defer any change until the extent to which technical differences between URL and IRI can be determined, especially any difference between web browser and other stacks.** *(Benjamin Young)*
{: .proposed_resolution}

> *Gregg Kellogg:* +1

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

> *Simon Steyskal:* +1

> *Tim Cole:* +1

> *David I. Lehn:* +1

> *David Newbury:* +1

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1

**Gregg Kellogg:** another factor is whether json-ld use of IRI makes some people see json-ld as not web browser friendly

#### 4.2. Inverse of @container:@set
{: #section4-2}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/17](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/17)

**Rob Sanderson:** next is issue #17  
… this came from a discussion with Dan that is broader than just schema.org  
… so with @container @set, we can say if this resource is present then its always an array, even if a single item  
… the issue in terms of expressing json-ld we don't have the opposite  
… we can't say I would like it compacted to a single value rather than an array  
… e.g., for reciepe use case was to show value for single step reciepe as a string rather than array  
… so this would mean some changes to compacting  

**Gregg Kellogg:** this impacts first, compaction  

> *Rob Sanderson:* +1 to gkellogg

**Gregg Kellogg:** but second how does a processor when expanding interpret a string value when defined that it could be array  
… this latter seems to impact schema.org users and instruction to them especially  
… I explained this in my last comment on the issue thread  
… I personally don't think the compaction issue is on its own a big deal, given that trend is encouragement to always use arrays when allowed as value for key  

> *Benjamin Young:* +1

**Benjamin Young:** the actual listing issue on allreciepes is microdata related because microdata can't do lists  
… so if run that use case through current microdata processor you get RDF that looks a little different  

**Gregg Kellogg:** to beat a deadhorse - decision was made to not overcomplicate things, but when microdata is dumb, we shouldn't want to dumb json-ld down to match  

> *Benjamin Young:* +1 to gkellogg yet again

**Rob Sanderson:** any other thoughts?  
… to clarify expansion part of issue, what happens now if you have a single string value for a key that is defined to be an array  

**Gregg Kellogg:** it gets turned into array  

**Rob Sanderson:** so close, won't fix, no compelling use cases  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we could include note in primer  

> **Proposed resolution: Close #17 won't fix, as no use cases for compaction, and expansion already works as expected** *(Rob Sanderson)*

{: #resolution3 .resolution}

#### 4.3. Recursion and @reverse - https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-framing/issues/5
{: #section4-3}

**Gregg Kellogg:** issue #5 is about how framing for reverse properties, but not adequate support  
… if you have a reverse property expressed in a frame, that property may have its own reverse properties, currently framing does not handle this  
… so seems a good idea to improve, but devil is in the details  
… this could be turned into an editors action, assuming we can get some support from other implementers  

**David Newbury:** support this approach, we anticipate running into this issue at the Getty  

**Rob Sanderson:** agree  
… principle of least surprise  
… so how does the WG feel about how we should continue to track and make sure it gets addressed?  
… not ready to go into detailed solution on this call, but do need other implementers to work with gkellog  

**Gregg Kellogg:** that sounds right - its partly a bandwidth issue of having a single editor  

> **Proposed resolution: Accept framing#5 but seek additional support in terms of implementation experience** *(Rob Sanderson)*

#### 4.4. Indexing with a predicate
{: #section4-4}

> *Benjamin Young:* [https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/19](https://github.com/w3c/json-ld-syntax/issues/19)

**Rob Sanderson:** issue #19 came up at Getty and IIIF over the past year  
… it's hard at API level to determine where you would find a repeated description of a resource  
… e.g., there's a bunch of items in a list with various properties  
… if you building an application consuming descriptions as json (rather than RDF), it would be nice to be able to find these descriptions  
… looking for a json surface level construct that makes it easier to find relevant descriptions further down  
… there has been promising development, but relies on a new keyword  
… so, do people support the feature? and then if yes, we can talk about solutions.  

**Gregg Kellogg:** we can certainly come up with solutions, but is this semantic overhead we want to add to json-ld just because it's available in other approaches  
… framing may help with this, but would result in repetition of statements  
… consistent with RDF which is happy with repetition of statements, although that is not a natural json approach  
… question is whether framing/repetition approach is sufficient  

**Jeff Mixter:** agree with usefulness of this, would be super-convenient  
… but I do have concerns about adding a keyword to do this  
… and I do think like @gkellog that there may be ways to do this without a new keyword  

**Benjamin Young:** my concerns echo Jeff's. We should look at how close we can get to this without existing json-ld mecahnisms  
… and not move forward with introducing something new until we've exhausted existing options  

**David Newbury:** when we started on this we tried 3 ways  
… the size of the document you have to send over the wire gets large, really verbose  

**Gregg Kellogg:** of course it is compressed when sent over the wire  

**David Newbury:** 3rd way we've done this is with reverse properties  
… saying this concept is inside this container, etc.  

> *Rob Sanderson:* [http://iiif.io/api/auth/1.0/#example-description-resource-with-authentication-services](http://iiif.io/api/auth/1.0/#example-description-resource-with-authentication-services)

**Rob Sanderson:** to give a sense of repeated data (see link above)  
… in IIIF we have idea of authentication service, which needs to be repeated for each resource  

> *David Newbury:* [http://aat-web-services-staging.getty.edu/aat/300390918.json](http://aat-web-services-staging.getty.edu/aat/300390918.json)

**Rob Sanderson:** so service block in example linked above is actually about the shortest  

> *David Newbury:* is the example of where we're doing it, with the `seeAlso` predicate

**Rob Sanderson:** and if you repeat it 500 times in the same document, the memory usage gets rediculous  
… may not be significant for modern browsers, but does become problem in mobile environment  

**Gregg Kellogg:** wondering how much this comes down to a data modelling issue?  
… can you model it by indirect reference approach?  
… this is more like what the framing would support  

> *Jeff Mixter:* +1 to the reference to a separate node for the iiif service issue

**Gregg Kellogg:** you end up with references rather than having to include  
… we're looking for another way to avoid repeating all properties up at node level  

**David Newbury:** in most consuming applications we've been using, the practice they recommend is shallow references as opposed to deeply nested structures  
… so we end up building a flatter structure  
… having a pattern that allows expressing in flatter structure would be good  

**Jeff Mixter:** i agree with David's comments  
… want to differentiate between graph-based use cases and IIIF use cases that want to cache and focus on json, not the RDF  

**Gregg Kellogg:** I'm wondering, should we explore a new framing mechanism as a way to address this?  
… something indirection mechanism in the framing  
… might not end up with round tripping solution  
… or do we need to keep in the existing expansion / compression options  

**Adam Soroka:** you're talking about a way to add to document when framed  

**Gregg Kellogg:** yes, for example if framing could allow you to pull info from references into the object being framed  
… don't have full solution yet, but trying to explore solution space  

**David Newbury:** I think this goes beyond framing, more about how we structure the data  
… the rdf should be the same however we do it  
… could end up with data section and included section  

**Adam Soroka:** some of the same concerns come up when we talk about using context to add new data  
… always a little worried about solutions that draw beyond the source, you end up with multiple sources  

> *Gregg Kellogg:* We might reconsider @default, then

**Rob Sanderson:** noting it is top of the hour, first agree with Adam, also agree this is a framing (rather than compaction) issue  

> *Adam Soroka:* gkellogg: yes, and I admit that I don't have clear thinking about that

**Rob Sanderson:** let's have a bit homework on this one.  
… please find examples and add to the issue, and look at framing rather than compaction  
… and add use cases  
… not ready to resolve, but this discussion was promising. Revisit next week.  
… Adjourn  

> *Adam Soroka:* bye y'all
