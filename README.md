# JSON-LD Working Group

This is the repository for the home page of the W3C JSON-LD Working Group:

https://www.w3.org/2018/json-ld-wg/

(That URL is redirected to the `w3c.github.io` view of this repository.)

## Specifications

GitHub repositories are linked from each specification. There is a separate [list of repos of this WG](https://github.com/search?q=topic%3Ajson-ld-wg+org%3Aw3c&type=Repositories).

All repositories for spec development share the same set of labels; inspired by the [labels organized for W3C specification](https://w3c.github.io/issue-metadata.html).

## Contributing to the JSON-LD Working Group Repositories

Use the standard fork, branch, and pull request workflow to propose changes to the specification. Please make branch names informativeâ€”by including the issue or bug number for example.

Editorial changes that improve the readability of the spec or correct spelling or grammatical mistakes are welcome.

Please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), about licensing contributions.
